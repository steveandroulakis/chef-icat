chef-icat
=========
A chef cookbook for deploying ICAT

Works on Vagrant's Lucid32 box thus far.

* TODO: set up paths for asadmin and starting/stopping db
* TODO: clean up hard-coded paths in recipe
* TODO: test on other VMs that aren't vagrant's lucid32 box
* TODO: make work on repeated calls of chef
* TODO: make more paths settable via external chef node configuration (eg. admin creds)
